            Who needs to use "lorem ipsum" when the human mind is perfectly capable of generating relatively meaningless,
            semantically null content? In my experience, people have never had a problem blathering on endlessly, their
            language and diction semantically correct while adding nothing to the infosphere around themselves. How many
            boring anecdotes could be repeated here verbatim and serve just as well as traditionally "greeked" text without
            the implied slights against the very cradle of our civilization?

            Surely, it's not too much to ask that our web designers dig down a little when they want meaningless text and come
            up with some rambling, meaningless bit of conversational drudgery to fill the space in their design without descending
            into pure gibberish.
